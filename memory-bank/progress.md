# Progress

## What Works
- The basic launcher structure is in place.
- It can check for updates against a remote manifest.
- It can download files and verify them with checksums.
- It can launch the application.
- It supports pausing, resuming, and canceling downloads.
- It can move the installation directory.
- It can uninstall the game (by moving it to the trash).
- The launcher itself is auto-updatable.

## What's Left to Build
- Further UI improvements.
- More robust error handling and user feedback.
- Potentially more configuration options for the user.
- Testing on different environments.

## Current Status
The project is functional but could be improved in terms of user experience and robustness.

## Known Issues
- The previous version had a UI issue where buttons were not displaying due to an incomplete login system. This has been reset.
